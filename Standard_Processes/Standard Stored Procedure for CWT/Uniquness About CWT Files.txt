Currently CWT files must be loaded directly into Production.
So, create sp in Production Database.

The reason files are loaded directly into Production is because

I.)

CWT sends data based on their change dates. 
If they make a change, for example to ReasonCodes,
then the change may generate a years worth of data causing huge files.


II.)

CWT sends an extra file containing Recordkeys to Delete before importing
which uses the dba.CWTGTEMP table. 
** This table must be in the database. (See file to create table)


Therefore, deleting large amounts of data across server takes up processing time and memory.
So, it is better to have this done in Production.

Currently,
A CWTHtlChains table is also used for converting 3 letter chain codes to 2 in CWT sps.
However this table is not maintained very much, because of the use of HNN.
